## Executive Summary

This repository is an attempt to explore the multi-faceted world of systems analysis and software design, mainly using C++ as the primary programming language. Each project aims to focus on a specific area of systems development, from the initial stages of requirements gathering to the more complex aspects of architectural design. The goal here is not to assert expertise but to offer a window into my journey of grasping the nuances of modern software engineering practices. Please consider this as an invitation to engage in a collaborative learning experience as we navigate through the complexities of software development.

## Technical Competencies & Skills

The projects within this repository aim to illustrate a fundamental understanding of various aspects of systems development and software engineering. While they showcase some skill in methodological problem-solving and technical communication, they also reflect ongoing learning and constant iteration. There's always room for growth and improvement, and these projects serve as a stepping stone in a long journey towards mastering software engineering principles. The main intention is to foster a dialog about best practices and innovative solutions in software design among professionals, peers, and other interested parties.

## Projects

### Comprehensive Requirements Analysis for DriverPass

#### Objective:

- Understand and apply domain analysis techniques.
- Elicit and capture nuanced business requirements.
- Produce a structured business requirements document.
- Establish a foundation for subsequent system development.

#### Technical Highlights:

In this project, domain analysis techniques were employed to gather business requirements from the hypothetical client, DriverPass. These requirements were then methodically compiled into a detailed business requirements document. The document served not just as a record but also as a guiding framework for subsequent phases of the project. Throughout this project, emphasis was placed on ensuring that the captured requirements aligned well with the envisioned system functionalities and provided a robust foundation for system architecture and design.

### Holistic System Design for DriverPass

#### Objective:

- Develop comprehensive architectural models.
- Utilize UML diagrams for visual representation.
- Create a thorough system design document.
- Effectively communicate design details to stakeholders.

#### Technical Highlights:

Building on the previously gathered requirements, this project aimed to craft a comprehensive system design document. The use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams was a key feature, providing a visual guide to the complex relationships and interactions within the designed system. Additionally, a presentation was crafted to help stakeholders understand the key aspects of the system design. Throughout the design phase, due diligence was exercised to ensure that the architectural decisions made were both scalable and aligned with the initial business requirements.

## Reflection & Technical Insights

### Project Overview & Achievements

The DriverPass concept aimed to explore the possibilities within digital driver's education solutions. The completed project resulted in a functional application that offered a broad array of features, from educational videos to practice tests and simulated real-world driving scenarios. It is important to note that while the project aimed for comprehensiveness, there were challenges along the way, particularly in aligning the technical aspects with user needs. Nevertheless, the end result is a humble yet promising step towards providing a more interactive and enriching driver's education experience.

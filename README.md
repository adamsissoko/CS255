**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design**

DriverPass is a company that wants to change the way that students study for driving exams. They wanted us to build a website that allows their customers to book driving sessions with trained instructors, take online practice exams, and get driving classes online.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I feel that I did a great job with the UML diagrams. I've finally begun to understand how to use LucidChart properly, and I enjoyed creating all of the diagrams for this project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would probably have a second look at my slideshow, and make an effort to improve the formatting. I would probably have chosen a different template, and added some more variety to the slides. All of the slides looked more or less the same, and this may make the overall slideshow less engaging for the viewers.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I reviewed the list of things that they were asking for, and made sure that each need would be met in my design. I also made an effort to carefully review the previous modules, and make sure that I had a clear understanding of how the UML diagrams would need to work. It is extremely important to consider the user's needs when designing because we are designing the system _**for them**_. If they aren't happy with the way the system works, we'll need to spend valuable time rewriting code and making changes to software. It's far more efficient to just keep the user in mind during the initial stages of the development process.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I try to write small pieces of code at a time and test them frequently. This helps me avoid creating hard-to-find bugs, and it saves time during the testing process, since I've already verified that each section of the program is working properly. In the future, I'll definitely consider making use of some UML diagrams to design systems. They seem very helpful, and there must be a reason why they're popular at so many large tech companies.

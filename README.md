# CS-255 System Analysis and Design: DriverPass Project

## Project Summary
This repository contains the DriverPass project, a full-cycle systems development effort aimed at creating a robust and user-friendly platform for driver's education. The project covers all phases of software development, from initial business requirements gathering to system modeling and design.

## Roles and Contributions
In this project, I took on various roles including that of a Business Analyst, System Designer, and UML Specialist. These roles enabled me to gain invaluable experience in several aspects such as:

- Requirement Analysis
- System Modeling
- Technical Communication with stakeholders

## Key Technical Accomplishments

- **Business Requirements Document**: Executed in-depth analysis to develop a comprehensive business requirements document.
  
- **System Design Document**: Employed industry-best tools to create a detailed system design document aligned with the defined business requirements.
  
- **UML Class Diagrams**: Created UML diagrams to act as the structural foundation for the system's development.

## Skills Highlight

- **Effective Communication**: Skillfully conveyed technical specifications and requirements to non-technical stakeholders.
  
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on a user-first approach to make the system as intuitive as possible for the target audience.

- **Structured Approach**: Adopted a systematic methodology to ensure logical and user-friendly system design.

## Areas for Growth
The project was overall successful; however, further refinement in UML class diagrams can be undertaken to provide an even more comprehensive system blueprint.

By offering a complete development solution for the DriverPass service, this project serves as a strong demonstration of my proficiency in system analysis, design, and stakeholder communication.

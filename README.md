# CS-255 System Analysis and Design: Coursework Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the CS-255 course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This course delves into the software development process from a business perspective, starting with requirements gathering and extending to the creation of various system models like use-case, action, and class diagrams.

## Official Course Description

The course equips students with the expertise to understand the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development. Students will also master the art of effectively communicating complex technical concepts and design decisions to various stakeholders.

## Projects

### Project One: Requirement Analysis for DriverPass

**Objective**: 
Explain the principles, methods, and techniques of systems development.

**Project Description**:  
Collected and analyzed business requirements from the hypothetical client, DriverPass, and documented these requirements through a business requirements document and a model application short paper.

---

### Project Two: System Design for DriverPass

**Objective**:  
- Create various system models using appropriate tools.  
- Effectively present and articulate technical concepts to non-technical audiences.

**Project Description**:  
Developed a comprehensive system design document based on the previously gathered requirements and also crafted a presentation to walk stakeholders through the system design.

## Final Reflections and Questions

### About the DriverPass Project

The client for this project was the fictional company, DriverPass, which aims to provide a comprehensive driver's education experience. They required an online application that serves as a one-stop-shop for educational videos, practice tests, and real-world driving experience.

### What Went Well

This project was an overall success, showcasing my adaptability as I took on various roles and responsibilities. From requirement analysis to system design, I was able to meet or exceed standards in all areas.

### Areas for Improvement

Although the project was largely successful, I wish I had more time to delve deeper into UML class diagrams, exploring more representation techniques to enrich the design blueprint.

### User-Centric Design Philosophy

Considering user needs is paramount in any system design. If a system is not intuitive for the user, itâ€™s likely to fail. My approach focuses on adopting the user's perspective, ensuring an intuitive and efficient experience.

### Future Approach to Software Design

Moving forward, I plan to continue embodying the role of the potential user while designing systems. Being organized and logical by nature, I aim for my systems to reflect these qualities, ensuring robustness and user-friendliness.
